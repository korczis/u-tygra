# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Static website for Pivnice U Tygra, a Czech pub in Brno. Built with Zola (Rust-based SSG), Alpine.js for interactivity, and Tailwind CSS via CDN. Single-page application with live beer menu pulled from Google Sheets CSV export.

Primary language is Czech (cs). All UI text, menu items, and business content are in Czech.

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
zola serve                # Dev server on port 1111 with hot reload
zola build                # Production build to public/
zola check                # Validate links and content structure
make quality-check        # Full quality gates (content + links + zola check)
make test                 # Alias for quality-check
make full-check           # clean + analyze + quality + build + health report
make clean                # Remove public/, .cache/, .sass-cache/
make help                 # List all 50+ Makefile targets
```

Requires Zola v0.22.1. No npm/node — Tailwind, Alpine.js, and Flowbite are loaded via CDN.

## Architecture

### Single-Page Structure

One Zola page (`content/_index.md`) rendered through `templates/index.html` → `templates/base.html`. All sections (hero, beer menu, food menu, private room, contact) live in the single template. Alpine.js handles navigation, scroll tracking, and data fetching.

### Live Beer Data Flow

```
Google Sheets (published CSV) → fetch in app.js → CSVWorkerManager (Web Worker) → liveBeers[] + announcement
```

The CSV is fetched client-side from a public Google Sheets export URL. Parsing happens off-main-thread via `static/js/csv-worker.js` with a main-thread fallback. The CSV URL and sheet GID are configured in `zola.toml` under `extra.sheets_id` / `extra.sheets_gid`.

**CSV column mapping** (from Google Sheets): Row 1 columns [2]-[5] form the announcement text. Beer rows use: `pivovar` (brewery), `nazev` (name), `styl` (style ID matching `beerStyles[].id`), `abv`, `cena` (price in CZK).

### Key Data in app.js

`static/js/app.js` is the entire Alpine.js application (~900 lines). It contains:
- `breweryUrls` / `breweryIcons` — hardcoded lookup tables for 25+ breweries (name → URL, name → icon category)
- `beerStyles` — 9 style categories with Czech/English names, colors, ABV/IBU ranges
- `foodItems` — full food menu with prices in CZK, categorized as `cold` / `warm`
- `CharlieAnalytics` — GA4 event tracking class (beer views, brewery clicks, style filters, PWA engagement)
- `hours` — opening hours array
- `didYouKnow` — rotating beer trivia facts

When adding a new brewery, update both `breweryUrls` and `breweryIcons` objects in `app.js`.

### URL Parameters

- `?kiosk=1` — activates kiosk mode (hides some UI elements, defaults to grid view)

### Styling

Custom Tailwind theme defined inline in `base.html` with two palettes:
- **tiger**: orange shades (`tiger-400`, `tiger-500`, etc.) — primary accent, base #f08c0f
- **brew**: brown shades (`brew-300`, `brew-500`, `brew-950`, etc.) — backgrounds/text, base #958757

`static/css/style.css` has custom effects: glass morphism, hero gradients, beer card animations, shimmer loading skeleton, dark map filter.

### Configuration

`zola.toml` holds all business data accessible in templates via `config.extra.*` — address, phones, company info (IČO, bank account), Google Sheets IDs, GA4 tracking ID.

## Dual Deployment

Two parallel pipelines deploy on push to main:
- **GitHub Pages** (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`): sed-rewrites `base_url` from GitLab to `https://korczis.github.io/u-tygra` at build time
- **GitLab Pages** (`.gitlab-ci.yml`): uses `base_url` from `zola.toml` as-is (`https://korczis.gitlab.io/u-tygra`)

**Important**: `base_url` in `zola.toml` targets GitLab Pages. The GitHub workflow rewrites it with `sed`. If you change the URL format in `zola.toml`, also update the sed pattern in `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.

## AIAD Ecosystem

The project uses an AIAD (AI-Augmented Development) framework:
- Agent configs in `.aiad/agents/` (content-validator, build-orchestrator, google-sheets-sync, docs-analyzer, quality-gate-sentinel, etc.)
- Executable commands in `.aiad/commands/`
- Manifest in `.aiad/manifest.toml`
- Documentation in `docs/` (modular: core, guides, reference, operations, architecture)

`make aiad-status` for ecosystem overview, `make aiad-agents` to list agents.
